Stronger
Por Kanye West
[SITE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronger_(Kanye_West_song)]

Work it, make it, do it
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger
N-n-now that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger

//---

Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(Work it harder, make it better)
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
I need you right now
(More than ever, hour after hour, work)
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness

'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastelle, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six and take this, haters

N-n-now that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(Work it harder, make it better)
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
I need you right now
(More than ever, hour after hour, work)
I need you right now (me likey)

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
It's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?

'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gonna do everything that Kan' like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
